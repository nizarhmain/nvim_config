Make sure to run `TSUpdate lua`

Install `ripgrep`, very much needed. Telescope will not work properly without it

`brew install ripgrep`

// convert the following scripts in a .sh down below and run them

```sh
brew install ripgrep

npm install -g typescript typescript-language-server

TSUpdate lua

```
