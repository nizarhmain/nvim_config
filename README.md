Make sure to run `TSUpdate lua`

Install `ripgrep`, very much needed. Telescope will not work properly without it

`brew install ripgrep`

// convert the following scripts in a .sh down below and run them

```bash
brew install ripgrep

npm install -g typescript typescript-language-server

TSUpdate lua

```

## Snippets stuff

[This was really helpful here](https://www.chiarulli.me/Neovim/17-snippets/)

Install pynvim

```
pip3 install pynvim
```

Install Coc Snippets

```
:CocInstall coc-snippets
```

```bash
pip3 install pynvim
```

## Useful commands:

```
// should show a list of all the vim.opt.* options

:help option-list

```

## Helpful video with more barebones setup
